# <img src="https://cdn.nba.com/logos/leagues/logo-nba.svg" style="height:20px; width:60px;"/> NBA bets live tracker  üèÄ

Project to track the live status of bets based on live statistics of the NBA games.

The idea is to have a tool to check if some bet is already reached or - in the worst case - don't, instead of manually checking stat by stat.

At this point, using the Flask framework to render the pages.
